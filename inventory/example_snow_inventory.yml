##There is a SNOW plugin that can dynamically create the inventory file from the CMDB, hereâ€™s is a draft. Would need a user and CMDB would need to be the single source of truth for the following fields:
##ip address, ios type, platform 

plugin: servicenow.servicenow.now
instance: anm.service-now.com
username: ansible_user
password: "{{ vault_SNOW }}"
vars:
  - name
  - ip_address
  - os (ios or nxos)
  - os_type (ios or iosxe)
  - platform type (for image truth)
groups:
  switches: "'sys_class_name' = 'cmdb_ci_ip_switch'"
  routers: "'sys_class_name' = 'cmdb_ci_ip_router'"
query: "'ip_addressISNOTNULL'"

##or operational status is not retired
